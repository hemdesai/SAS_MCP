# SAS MCP Server MVP Approaches

## Overview

This repository contains three main approaches for interacting with the SAS MCP Server. Each approach is developed in its own branch:

### 1. MCP Inspector UI (`mcp-inspector`)
- Minimal interface for technical users to directly inspect and query the SAS MCP Server.
- No chatbot or conversational UI.

### 2. React Chatbot (No LLM) (`react-chatbot`)
- Interactive chatbot built in React.
- Uses scripted rules and logic (no AI/LLM).
- Demonstrates conversational UI without advanced natural language understanding.

### 3. LLM Chatbot (`llm-chatbot`)
- Full-featured chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (LLM).
- Supports natural language queries and advanced interactions with the SAS MCP Server.

Main branch contains this overview and shared documentation. For details and code, switch to the relevant branch.
